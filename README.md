GDCD was created in part using the Yahoo Answers corpus: <a href="https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=l">L6 - Yahoo! Answers Comprehensive Questions and Answers version 1.0</a>. The Yahoo Answers corpus can be requested free of charge for research purposes. Access to GDCD (and the accompanying code) will require users to first gain access to this Yahoo Answers corpus.

Once you have gained access to the L6 corpus, please forward the acknowledgment to Joel Tetreault (joel.tetreault@grammarly.com) and we will give you access to the Grammarly Corpus of Discourse Coherence and accompanying code. Please let us know if you have any questions.
